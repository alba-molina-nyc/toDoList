1. Create an HTML file that contains a form to add tasks and a list to display tasks.
2. Create a CSS file to style the HTML elements.
3. Write JavaScript code to handle the following functionality:
4. Add new tasks to the list when the user submits the form.
5. Display tasks in the list with the option to mark them as complete or delete them.
6. Update the status of tasks when the user marks them as complete.
7. Filter the list based on task status (e.g. all, completed, or incomplete).
8. Test your application to make sure it works as expected.
